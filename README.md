# PyGame - Zombie Game  
  
### Why This Project?  
Taking a break from quite a gruelling period on my NHS Waiting Times Web App to work on something a bit more exciting for a week.  
  
### Learning Objectives  
Primary aim is to really deep dive into OOP and class based structure, and arguably the best enviornment for OOP is a game environment (lots of reapeated objects, lots of complex relationships between classes).   
Secondary aim is to explore some of the more intermediate and advanced concepts in python and relearn some of the things I knew once from mathematics for graphics and rendering.
