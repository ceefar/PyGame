see todo btw

reduced accuracy when moving
improved when standing still
as part of player state 

when grouped up, i.e. x amount pushing on each other,
have these zombies only display their hp bar nothing else 

you need lol style square level bar around ur level number btw (already written but is key)
- this is the kinda thing id also want as part of some on sceen ui for likely than not tbf



todo
- move over sprites n zombies n ting
- add gold like health bosh
- OMGOMG, for random spinner when you hit a level it just puts a slots spinner over u
    - instead of ur bar and it spins and then you win it bosh
    - note after you need lol style square level bar around ur level number btw
    - this would be so sick and easy to do and really just call that the whole mechanic
    - well like pretty much all of it or the main part of it
    - for this mvp for github project 
        - (as wanna go back to DE then return to a new godot or pygame project after)
    - remember da fluffy potato and aim more for polish in a few aspects than hella content
    - especially for this as a first pygame game dev project ffs duhhhh
    

- design zombies basic 2.5d just to see! 

note
- should look into node state machine afterwards
