N0TES
- have removed change weapon disbaled when zombies are near, will likely add back at a much closer range (this must be super clear to the player if so) 
- have reduced change weapon cd from 3 sec to 1 sec
- moving should reduce accuracy
- standing still should have improved accuracy (important for broken leg stuff)



RNRN 
- finish tut
- quickly do image and basic implementation of selfie
- fork gui repo to check it out
- do 3x cards + skilltree test
- do traps or similar 100%
- various below stuff in asap
- do new version n ting (obvs hella notes here to check first )



ASAP 
- note some things could be done when starting new version and actually probs better to do then due to messy codebase / need for new version anyways
- also note some things are done 
-------------------------------------------
- add traps or similar 100%
- 3 card / skilltree ui stuff
- some kinda basic broken leg ui, as an icon should be fine tbf!
- melee attack, does knockback, needs good timing
    - need to take into consideration the zombies range, ours needs to be slightly higher
    - this attack should still have a short cooldown and can be done with any weapon, its an elbow hit / gun butt
- proper change weapon system
    - want shotgun as ammo but isnt showing in weapons now so fix dat (dw about ammo until new version)
- selfie ting
    - see below in game needs
    - could refund health too
- idea of glory kills til like doom too tbf
- start/stop sign on floor tiles and other easy custom tiles e.g. trees from this guys stuff
    - https://gamedeveloperstudio.itch.io/top-down-city-mega-pack
- custom event stuff
    - various, see below
- casino blocking zombies fix
    - remember might be putting this on zombies instead
        - note other considerations were for having level up points on the map, and having AQKJ10 etc on zombies for bonus gold also
    - should test anyways
- 180 button needs work 
    - i.e if press button and holding forward u should now be moving back
    - dw about this for now is fine as is
- manual reloading duh
    - worked by adding 1 bool to R button, gg4dat
    - evidence codebase is messy but well designed
- reduce or remove change weapon wait stuff



GAME NEEDS
- neeeeds 180 quick turn
    - ngl 100 add take a selfie
        - multiplier for the more zombies "in shot"
            - consider trying to actually do this with pillow.similar based on what its the sight range lmao, would be kewl 
        - obvs u stand still while taking
        - would have some anim and flash too
            - the flash will alert near by zombies too (maybe offscreen whatevs)
- proper change weapon system
- more things to do, doesnt have to be loads but needs to feel like a game
    - feel like looting and crafting is enough with 1 / 2 / 3 rotating objective types
- intro idea ting!
- objectives
- tutorial style things for first time things
    - e.g. zombies that are close to you will land charge attacks that do more damage
    - when you take more damage you drastically increase your risk of sustaining a serious injury
    - if you break a leg your movement will be seriously impacted
    - your special weapon may run out of ammo
    - you can find x at y
    - you can make blah with blah at blah
    - you can get health at blah
    - you can get a companion at blah


HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE
to do menus pls not only consider tut/s but
find legit (good, clean) examples, will make it so much easier!

ONCE TUT DONE
final version with high polish
javascript react front end project next
    - then maybe mobile app in google one 
    - plus actually start doing alls job applications 
        - looking mostly for apprenticeship and jnr roles
