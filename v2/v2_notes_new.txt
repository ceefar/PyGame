N0TES
- have removed change weapon disbaled when zombies are near, will likely add back at a much closer range (this must be super clear to the player if so) 
- have reduced change weapon cd from 3 sec to 1 sec
- moving player should reduce your accuracy
- standing still should have improved accuracy (important for broken leg stuff)
- skipped proper flash, probs should just remove or just have like muzzleflash duh



RNRN 

- spinner
    - with working functionality
- do flash with the yellow, tho quite a bit more alpha
    - and a muzzleflash img style ting by the phone, BOSH!
- fork gui repo to check it out
- do 3x cards + skilltree test
- do traps or similar 100%
- atleast test pillow for dynamic based on zombie count and possibly like quadrant of the map or sumnt
    - if u wanted it to be hella simple just have it like an achievement where u gotta take 1 in each quadrant asnd it gives u sumnt special (obvs then just 4 unique images too)
- various below stuff in asap
- quickly do image and basic implementation of selfie
- do new version n ting (obvs hella notes here to check first)

KEWL IDEA 
its a gameshow so 
you also get odds of suriving the next X time, if u do u win the odds vs ur gamble!
so sick
then plus also could be tied to the level up i.e. could be when it triggers the menu

ASAP 
- note some things could be done when starting new version and actually probs better to do then due to messy codebase / need for new version anyways
- also note some things are done 
-------------------------------------------
[WANT TO HAVE]
- finish tut first pls is like 20 mins ffs
- 3 card / skilltree ui stuff


[NICE TO HAVE - I.E => PROBABLY DO BEFORE START FINAL BUT DONT NEED TO DO OR EVEN ADD TBF]
- add traps or similar 100%
    - press button
    - perform action chargebar and animation (no anim rn tho, just change img if anything)
    - trap is placed like items
    - then can do loads of sick upgrade stuff for this 
- selfie ting
    - see below in game needs
    - could refund health too
    - similar mechanic to above traps so will be easy to roll out all 3 of these tonight / tomo
- idea of glory kills til like doom too tbf
- proper change weapon system
    - want shotgun as ammo but isnt showing in weapons now so fix dat (dw about ammo until new version)
    - dont need to do this here tbf
    - just remember to do as ammo when doing final version
- start/stop sign on floor tiles and other easy custom tiles e.g. trees from this guys stuff
    - https://gamedeveloperstudio.itch.io/top-down-city-mega-pack
- custom event stuff
    - various, see below
- casino blocking zombies fix
    - remember might be putting this on zombies instead
        - note other considerations were for having level up points on the map, and having AQKJ10 etc on zombies for bonus gold also
    - should test anyways

[THINK ALLOW TBF?]
- melee attack, does knockback, needs good timing
    - need to really think for this and redo a tut portion that will be most similar to what i want at the same time
        - print lots of rects lol, see commented out attempt
    - need to take into consideration the zombies range, ours needs to be slightly higher
    - this attack should still have a short cooldown and can be done with any weapon, its an elbow hit / gun butt

[PART DONE FROM ABOVE]
- some kinda basic broken leg ui, as an icon should be fine tbf! [PART DONE]
- 180 button needs work 
    - i.e if press button and holding forward u should now be moving back
    - dw about this for now is fine as is
- manual reloading duh
    - worked by adding 1 bool to R button, gg4dat
    - evidence codebase is messy but well designed
- reduce or remove change weapon wait stuff



GAME NEEDS
- neeeeds 180 quick turn
    - ngl 100 add take a selfie
        - multiplier for the more zombies "in shot"
            - consider trying to actually do this with pillow.similar based on what its the sight range lmao, would be kewl 
        - obvs u stand still while taking
        - would have some anim and flash too
            - the flash will alert near by zombies too (maybe offscreen whatevs)
- proper change weapon system
- more things to do, doesnt have to be loads but needs to feel like a game
    - feel like looting and crafting is enough with 1 / 2 / 3 rotating objective types
- intro idea ting!
- objectives
- tutorial style things for first time things
    - e.g. zombies that are close to you will land charge attacks that do more damage
    - when you take more damage you drastically increase your risk of sustaining a serious injury
    - if you break a leg your movement will be seriously impacted
    - your special weapon may run out of ammo
    - you can find x at y
    - you can make blah with blah at blah
    - you can get health at blah
    - you can get a companion at blah


HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE
to do menus pls not only consider tut/s but
find legit (good, clean) examples, will make it so much easier!

ONCE TUT DONE
final version with high polish
javascript react front end project next
    - then maybe mobile app in google one 
    - plus actually start doing alls job applications 
        - looking mostly for apprenticeship and jnr roles

then probably godot

LEGIT
# finish tutorial
# do the advanced tuts, e.g. dykstras etc
# - fuck all point doing the port stuff until you've done all important tuts imo 
# new version and start porting over functionalities and completely finishing them before continuing
# - will actually be hella easy this way dw


TOD0

# update gamble idea to on zombie thing on phone
# 3 cards x skilltree thing
# ui and menus 
# port stuff in a new version when ready to start finalising

# gold coin sprite


GENERAL THINGS TODO

# why wasnt tweening working
# - complete the tut on blank fork to check wassup

# reels thing
# - aka move/blit the casino ui to the screen if it blocks zombies

# events
# - do event functionality for on player level up which is based on a set amount of gold which will be easy tbf

# add borders code to damage numbers
# - for new version, too much to untangle

# reduced accuracy when moving
# - improved when standing still
# - as part of player state 

# you need lol style square level bar around ur level number btw (already written but is key)
# - this is the kinda thing id also want as part of some on sceen ui for likely than not tbf

# add uzi unlocked text and image
# - do like current reloading tbf, use the same funct too bosh

# reloading (?)


PART DONE
- procedural zombie spawning
- basic grouping

YEAH SO NO CAP RN DO THE 3X MENU TING AND SKILL TREES
TOMO WE 100% FINISH THIS TUT (and start maps and graphics n tings oooo)

SKILLTREES
maybe bonus level points are also on the map 
(could be only on the map, possibly procedural too could be interesting anyways)

freeze enemies (only if can find something that makes sense? - lol really... no)

cant unlock all?


ALSO
# gold coin sprite




CONSIDER
- as per gmtk, economies (i mean so much tbf amazing video)
- breakable weapons and/or weapon quality
- tutorial where you play and on floor text tells u things
- as much do and not text as possible 

SOME GENERAL GMTK THINGS
- have the game comment on the choices you make
- some kinda mission or whatever where if u take too long the person is just dead when u arrive
- the idea of invisible, but tracked, choices, is so kewl


its top down, think gta chinatown!
