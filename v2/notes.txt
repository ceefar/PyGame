- should draw to a new surf instead and then blit that btw
- actually should just have a new class for this, that has the surf and then you blit to that classes image than blit the class img with the unit i.e. player, companion, zombie, bwall, etc
- that new surf could also be attached to the zombies position but just be a transparent bar above them for ui
